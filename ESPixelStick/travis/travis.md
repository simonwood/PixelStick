Development Release (Auto-Generated)
====================================
This release was auto-generated by [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/forkineye/ESPixelStick).  ESP8266 Arduino and all required libraries were pulled from their current github repositories.  This release is meant for testing purposes and **is not** considered stable. The latest stable release can be found on the [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/forkineye/ESPixelStick/releases/latest).  EFU files for updating are not included, however you can create them yourself within ESPSFlashTool.
